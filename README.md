# Title: HIKESTELLATION

# The Concept:
The concept of this app is to enhance stargazing experiences by providing users with information on the availability of constellations at specific times of the year and in certain locations. By leveraging multiple APIs, such as NASA's celestial data and the National Parks Service's trail information, the app will not only inform users about when and where they can observe their favorite constellations but also recommend nearby hiking trails within national parks, ensuring that users have an enriched celestial and outdoor adventure.

# How It Works:
- Constellation Data: The app would first collect data on the visibility and timing of constellations throughout the year. This data can be sourced from NASA APIs or specialized constellation APIs.
- User Preferences: Users would set their preferences, such as their location, the specific constellations they wish to see, and the time of year they plan to stargaze.
- Location-Based Recommendations: Using the user's preferences, the app would determine the optimal time and location for observing the selected constellations. This might involve cross-referencing user location with celestial data and providing recommendations for specific dates and times when the constellations are visible.
- National Park Data: The app would also integrate with the National Parks Service API to access information about hiking trails within national parks. It would provide details about the trails, such as difficulty level, distance, and any special features.
- Recommendations: Based on the user's preferences and the availability of constellations, the app would recommend nearby national park hiking trails that offer the best vantage points for stargazing. Users can then choose from these recommendations and plan their outdoor adventure accordingly.
- User Engagement: The app can offer additional features to engage users, such as sharing stargazing experiences, providing educational content about constellations, and allowing users to rate and review the recommended trails.

# Potential API:
- NASA/Astronomy API: To retrieve data about the visibility of constellations, celestial events, and celestial object information.
