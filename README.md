# Title: GeoGrooves
User-Generated Ambient Music Experience


# The Concept:
Create a mobile application that allows users to enhance their surroundings with personalized music playlists. When users enter a specific location (such as a caf√©, park, or gym), they can submit their preferred music choices for that ambiance. Other users visiting the same location can vote on submitted playlists, and the most popular playlist is played in the venue. This creates a crowd-curated ambiance, making the experience more personal and engaging for everyone present.

# How It Works:
- Location registration:
Location managers can view songs uploaded to the location from other user's and get a playlist that will include user's input. 
- Location Check-In:
When users enter a specific location, they check in through the app.
- Music Submission:
Users can submit their preferred music playlists for the current location. 


# Potential API:
- Google Maps API for location data:
Utilize the Google Maps API to fetch location data and enable users to check in at specific venues.
Allow users to add custom markers or tags to locations to associate them with specific ambiance preferences.

- Spotify Web API for music data:  
Implement Spotify Web API to enable users to create playlists, access tracks, and get music recommendations.
Integrate features that allow users to import their existing Spotify playlists into GeoGrooves.

# Security: 
- Implement OAuth for secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify their accounts.
